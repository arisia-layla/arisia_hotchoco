Arisia_Hotchoco Language official document
This document covers the main system of the arisia programming language. If you use this language, you can use it as freely as Python. Enjoy our language!

Our language is the simplest programming language in the world and aims at the machine language level. So you don't need a more complicated programming language and you will get execution speed comparable to or faster than C. Our ultimate goal is to integrate Ai into code to make coding automatic.

This programming language is licensed under the MIT license. You are free to develop and modify it in this language. However, redistribution of non-official languages ​​is prohibited +

# Installation
To code in this language, you need to install a language interpreter on your system such as C or Python. This language is being optimized at the machine language level. You can install & run the interpreter through the arisiainstaller.exe file.

If you encounter any errors during execution, please contact us on Github discussion, stackoverflow, or discussion.arisia.space. Bug fixes ( Fork ) and emails are always welcome email: dev@arisia.space

Installation Link : program.arisia.space/language/latest/arisiainstaller.exe

To write and save the code, save it by appending ".arisia" to the format of the binary file.
The peculiar thing is that this language allows you to change the save format of the interpreter as you like, the default is arisia. To run on your computer, you need to modify the source parser code on the other computer. Arisia will work without problems based on

# Useage
This section covers how to use this language

// Hello world print


say(hello world)

You don't need string separator "" ? no need just enter

// repeat

<Tag>
  .tag{
    start : 3,
    end : 4,
    count : 1
  }
<Tag/>
repeat(#tag)

Do you know CSS? If you know, it will be much easier to use. All complex syntax is written through tag ( Tag ), which is defined through the < Tag > code at the top. Of course, this is set by the default preset. You just need to repeat + Tab and just change the number.

// server
The server, too, is troublesome to open, and many packages are troublesome to work with. But in this language you don't need it. Why? Because it's already there? server(#server1) Now, the server configuration is complete. All security policies are provided at a similar level to helmet through built-in package 

server(#server1)

Handling post, get, update, delete requests? The basic structure that is automatically designed inside is as follows. /address/api , get, post auto. If you enter this server and run the file, ./html/index.html is automatically created in the path. You can modify it freely. Of course, mobile and pc apps are also available using porting. How to use porting < You can wrap all code with porting> </porting>, note: You must include <Tag> as well.

# Database

Need a database? SQL is built-in by default. You can perform it through SQL.on sql(#conn) Now, sql connection is complete.
Then let's open the sql server.
sql.openserver(#server2) Server created! All these databases are created in the installation path, and Nosql is also provided. For no sql, use nosql.openserver(#server2)

Finally, there is the biggest advantage of this language. Code written in another language can run in this language. For example, for Python code that pulls a datetime time, you can convert it to import datetime => (no declaration) and specify print(datetime.datetime.now()) as a say(time) or say(#time) tag.

# Greetings
Finally, to wrap things up, this language is going to be able to do everything. For example.. IOT, AI, BIGDATA, OS, DATABASE, WEB, FRONT, BACK... You may not need a separate language anymore. Can it be started without JS on the web? yes It works through WASM and JS converters. You can create apps, games, 3D or 2D anything in this language. AI will assist you. Also, the language provides multi-version compatibility. You can use separate packages as imports, but you don't have to. Because we offer it all in this language. Again. Thanks programmer for choosing this language
